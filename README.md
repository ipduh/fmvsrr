A Maintenance and Configuration Cost Calculator for iBGP setups

A comparison of BGP as iGP with next-hop-self in a fully connected mesh vs BGP as iGP with next-hop-self
with two Route Reflectors.

This is an effort to point the obvious,
quantify he best of the two setups in terms of configuration and maintenance cost
and it is inspired by a quest in the AWMN mailing list to find the best intraAS setup for AWMN nodes with many routers .
